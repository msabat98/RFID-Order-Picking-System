# RFID-Order-Picking-System
This project aims to investigate which IoT technologies currently exist in warehouses and how  they can be adapted to propose a solution which will automate and improve the order picking  process. The basis of this investigation will focus on using a WMS which integrates IoT  technology which will optimise order picking through automating inventory locating, standard  routing policies to find the optimal picking route and providing a warehouse simulation model  for a hand-held device tool which is used by warehouse employees aiming to enhance the speed  of the picking process, and provide the most efficient picking route to complete an order.
